# Giorgio-Discrete-Event-Sim
Project 1 for CIS 3207

Summary:
An event simulator, written in C, to emulate the process of queues and scheduling/completing events.

9/8 Update:
Currently the Priority Queue and FIFO Queue structures and functions have been tested and are working properly.
Next I need to create a random number generator and begin the event handler.
